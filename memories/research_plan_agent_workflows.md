# Research Plan: Agent Workflow Orchestration and Parallel Agent Patterns

## Research Objectives
Comprehensive analysis of multi-agent workflow orchestration covering architecture patterns, communication mechanisms, visualization techniques, and best practices.

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation Research
- [x] 1.1 Multi-agent workflow patterns and architectures
- [x] 1.2 Agent communication and coordination mechanisms
- [x] 1.3 Visual workflow representation for agent systems

### Phase 2: Technical Deep Dive
- [x] 2.1 Parallel agent execution patterns
- [x] 2.2 Workflow visualization techniques and tools
- [x] 2.3 Agent persona design and specialization

### Phase 3: Practical Applications
- [x] 3.1 Workflow templates for common development scenarios
- [x] 3.2 Best practices for agent orchestration and management

### Phase 4: Synthesis and Documentation
- [x] 4.1 Compile findings into comprehensive report
- [x] 4.2 Create workflow patterns reference
- [x] 4.3 Final review and validation

## Research Strategy
- Use multiple source types: academic papers, industry documentation, technical blogs, and framework documentation
- Focus on current best practices (2023-2025)
- Include both theoretical foundations and practical implementations
- Gather real-world examples and case studies

## Target Sources
- Academic research on multi-agent systems
- Industry frameworks (AutoGPT, LangChain, CrewAI, etc.)
- Technical documentation and whitepapers
- Developer community discussions and patterns
- Workflow orchestration platforms and tools
