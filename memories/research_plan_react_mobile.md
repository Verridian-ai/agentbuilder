# React Mobile Implementation Research Plan

## Task Overview
Comprehensive research on React mobile frameworks and implementation strategies covering 8 key areas.

## Research Areas & Progress

### 1. React Native vs React Web Mobile Frameworks
- [x] 1.1 Compare React Native architecture and capabilities
- [x] 1.2 Analyze React web mobile frameworks (Next.js, Vite, etc.)
- [x] 1.3 Performance comparison and use cases
- [x] 1.4 Development experience and tooling differences

### 2. Mobile-Specific React Libraries and Components
- [x] 2.1 UI component libraries for mobile (React Native Elements, UI Kitten, etc.)
- [x] 2.2 Web mobile libraries (React Router, React Spring, etc.)
- [x] 2.3 Navigation libraries and patterns
- [x] 2.4 Date/time and input libraries

### 3. Touch Gesture Libraries for React Applications
- [x] 3.1 React Native gesture libraries (React Native Gesture Handler, etc.)
- [x] 3.2 Web touch gesture libraries (React Touch Events, etc.)
- [x] 3.3 Swipe, pinch, and drag gesture implementations
- [x] 3.4 Custom gesture handling approaches

### 4. Mobile-First CSS Frameworks and Approaches
- [x] 4.1 CSS frameworks (Tailwind CSS, Styled Components, Emotion)
- [x] 4.2 Mobile-first design principles and breakpoints
- [x] 4.3 Responsive design strategies
- [x] 4.4 CSS-in-JS vs traditional CSS approaches

### 5. Progressive Web App (PWA) Strategies for Complex Tools
- [x] 5.1 PWA setup and configuration (service workers, manifests)
- [x] 5.2 Offline functionality implementation
- [x] 5.3 App-like features (push notifications, camera access)
- [x] 5.4 Performance optimization for complex applications

### 6. Mobile Performance Optimization Techniques
- [x] 6.1 React performance optimization (memo, useMemo, useCallback)
