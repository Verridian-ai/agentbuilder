# Research Plan: Code Generation and Execution Capabilities for Agent Builders

## Task Overview
Research and analyze code generation and execution capabilities needed for agent builders, covering 5 key areas:
1. Code generation APIs and models
2. Code execution environments (sandboxing, security)
3. Testing and debugging tools
4. Version control integration
5. Multi-language support

## Research Strategy
This is a **verification-focused task** requiring deep technical analysis of existing tools, platforms, and methodologies. I need to gather information from authoritative sources, analyze technical specifications, and synthesize findings into actionable insights.

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Information Gathering
- [x] 1.1 Search for current code generation APIs and models
- [x] 1.2 Research code execution environments and sandboxing solutions
- [x] 1.3 Investigate testing and debugging tools for AI-generated code
- [x] 1.4 Explore version control integration patterns
- [x] 1.5 Analyze multi-language support requirements and solutions

### Phase 2: Deep Analysis
- [ ] 2.1 Extract detailed information from key sources (documentation, technical papers)
- [ ] 2.2 Analyze security considerations for code execution
- [ ] 2.3 Compare different approaches to code generation and execution
- [ ] 2.4 Evaluate integration patterns and best practices

### Phase 3: Synthesis and Documentation
- [ ] 3.1 Organize findings by the 5 key areas
- [ ] 3.2 Create comprehensive analysis document
- [ ] 3.3 Provide actionable recommendations and insights
- [ ] 3.4 Final review and validation

## Success Criteria
- Complete coverage of all 5 specified areas
- Technical depth with specific examples and tools
- Actionable insights for agent builders
- Well-documented sources and verification
- Professional report suitable for technical decision-making

## Target Output
- Comprehensive report saved to `research/code_capabilities/code_capabilities.md`
- Minimum 10 high-quality sources from diverse categories
- Technical specifications and implementation details
- Security considerations and best practices
