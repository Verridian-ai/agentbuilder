# Research Plan: Agent Builder Platform Technical Requirements

## Task Overview
Research and analyze technical requirements for building an agent builder platform, covering frontend, backend, security, database, and collaboration features.

## Research Components
1. **Frontend Frameworks for Visual Programming**
   - [x] React Flow capabilities and limitations
   - [x] D3.js for custom visualizations
   - [x] Alternative frameworks (Vue.js, Angular)
   - [x] Graph libraries and node-based editors
   - [x] Performance considerations

2. **Backend Architectures for Agent Execution**
   - [x] Microservices vs monolithic approaches
   - [x] Container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)
   - [x] Message queues and event systems
   - [x] API design patterns
   - [x] Scalability considerations

3. **Code Execution Environments and Security**
   - [x] Sandboxing technologies
   - [x] Container security
   - [x] Code isolation patterns
   - [x] Resource limitations
   - [x] Security best practices

4. **Database Design for Agent Templates and Configurations**
   - [x] Schema design patterns
   - [x] Version control for configurations
   - [x] Template management systems
   - [x] Performance optimization
   - [x] Data persistence strategies

5. **Real-time Collaboration Features**
   - [x] WebSocket implementations
   - [x] Operational transformation algorithms
   - [x] Conflict resolution strategies
   - [x] State synchronization
   - [x] User management and permissions
