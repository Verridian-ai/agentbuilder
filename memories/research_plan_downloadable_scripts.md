# Research Plan: Downloadable Script Patterns and Auto-Setup Systems for Development Tools

## Research Objectives
Investigate patterns and best practices for creating downloadable scripts and auto-setup systems for development environments, focusing on tools like VS Code extensions, terminal-based setups, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Research Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation Research
- [x] 1.1 Research existing development tools and their downloadable configuration patterns
- [x] 1.2 Investigate major IDE/Editor configuration export/import systems (VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.)
- [x] 1.3 Analyze package managers and their setup script approaches (npm, pip, Homebrew, etc.)

### Phase 2: Terminal-Based Setup Patterns
- [x] 2.1 Research shell script patterns for cross-platform environment setup
- [x] 2.2 Investigate bootstrap scripts and initialization patterns
- [x] 2.3 Analyze terminal automation tools and their distribution methods

### Phase 3: VS Code Extension Configuration Systems
- [x] 3.1 Research VS Code extension export/import mechanisms
- [x] 3.2 Investigate workspace settings and extensions.json patterns
- [x] 3.3 Analyze VS Code devcontainer and settings sync approaches

### Phase 4: Best Practices and Implementation Strategies
- [x] 4.1 Research one-click setup methodologies
- [x] 4.2 Investigate script packaging and distribution strategies
- [x] 4.3 Analyze version management and update mechanisms

### Phase 5: Platform Compatibility and Security
- [x] 5.1 Research cross-platform compatibility requirements (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [x] 5.2 Investigate security considerations for downloadable scripts
- [x] 5.3 Analyze signature verification and trust establishment methods

### Phase 6: Documentation and Report Generation
- [x] 6.1 Synthesize findings into comprehensive patterns
- [x] 6.2 Create implementation recommendations
- [x] 6.3 Generate final report with code examples and best practices
